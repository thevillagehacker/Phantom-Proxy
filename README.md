## What is PhantomProxy?

PhantomProxy is a lightweight in-browser security testing tool inspired by Burp Suite's proxy and repeater workflow. It captures all HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your browser tab in real time, lets you inspect every request and response in detail, replay and modify requests, decode tokens, manage your test scope, and bookmark interesting findings — all without setting up a system proxy, installing Java, or leaving your browser.

## Installation

### Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store
Search for **PhantomProxy** on the [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/) store and click Install.

### Load Unpacked (Developer Mode)
1. Download and extract the `phantom-proxy.zip`
2. Open `edge://extensions/` (or `chrome://extensions/`)
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (top-right toggle)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `phantom-proxy` folder
5. Open any page → press **F12** → click the **PhantomProxy** tab in DevTools

### Standalone Window
Click the PhantomProxy icon in your toolbar → click **◈ EXECUTE** to open PhantomProxy as a full dedicated window. Ideal for a second monitor or a focused testing session.

## Features

### ◎ Scope Tab
Define exactly which targets you care about before you start testing.

- Add domains manually, paste a full URL (hostname is auto-extracted), or click **ADD ALL FROM HISTORY** to pull every domain from your current capture into scope in one shot
- Wildcard support — `*.example.com` matches the root domain and all subdomains
- Two display modes: **DIM** (out-of-scope requests stay visible but greyed out) or **HIDE** (removed entirely)
- Scope state persists across sessions via browser storage — your targets are remembered when you reopen DevTools
- Scope badge in the topbar always shows current state at a glance

---

### ◈ History Tab
Passive, real-time capture of all HTTP/HTTPS traffic — no proxy configuration required.

**Capture**
- All requests captured via the browser's `webRequest` API the moment the panel opens
- Up to 500 requests stored in memory, oldest dropped when limit reached
- **⟳ RELOAD PAGE TO CAPTURE FROM START** nudge — reloads the inspected tab so you never miss the initial page load requests
- Pause / Resume capture without losing history
- Clear all with one click

**Filter Bar — Row 1**
- Free-text search across full URLs (domain, path, query string)
- Method filter chips: ALL · GET · POST · PUT · DEL · PATCH · OPT
- Status code filter: ALL · 2xx · 3xx · 4xx · 5xx · ERR
- Live request counter showing filtered vs total

**Filter Bar — Row 2**
- **Type filter (multi-select):** ALL · XHR · FETCH · JS · CSS · HTML · IMG · FONT · MEDIA · WS · OTHER — select any combination simultaneously
- **IN SCOPE ONLY** chip — instantly restricts the list to your defined scope domains, independent of the global DIM/HIDE mode
- **HIGHLIGHTED ONLY** chip — shows only bookmarked/highlighted requests

**Request List**
- Each row shows: method, status code, URL (domain highlighted separately from path), auto-detected FLAGS badges, resource type, and timing
- Color-coded left border stripe on highlighted rows
- Three-dot hover indicator on every row — right-click to bookmark

**Auto-highlight FLAGS**
PhantomProxy automatically detects and badges interesting requests:

| Badge | What it detects |
|---|---|
| JWT | JWT token in any request header |
| API KEY | `x-api-key`, `api_key=` parameter |
| AUTH | Bearer / Basic auth headers |
| ADMIN | `/admin`, `/dashboard`, `/console`, `/manage` paths |
| SENSITIVE | `/password`, `/reset`, `/token`, `/config`, `/.env` |
| UPLOAD | File upload endpoints, `multipart/form-data` |
| 403 | Forbidden responses — worth testing for bypasses |
| 5xx | Server errors |
| SQL? | SQL patterns in request bodies |
| GraphQL | `/graphql` endpoint or mutation/query body |
| WS | WebSocket connections |

**Request Detail Pane**
Click any row to open the full detail view:
- REQ HEADERS — all request headers in a clean key/value table
- REQ BODY — raw request body
- RES HEADERS — response headers
- RES PRETTY — re-fetches the request and renders the response with full syntax highlighting (JSON keys, strings, numbers, booleans, null each in a distinct color; XML formatted and indented)
- RAW — full raw HTTP request reconstruction
- **⟳ SEND TO REPEATER** — sends the request to a new Repeater session
- **⎘ COPY AS CURL** — copies a shell-ready cURL command to clipboard

**Bookmark / Highlight System**
Right-click any request row to open the highlight menu:
- 8 color swatches: Red, Orange, Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Pink
- Optional text note attached to the bookmark (shows as tooltip)
- Remove highlight option
- Bookmarks persist across sessions
- Use **HIGHLIGHTED ONLY** filter to isolate bookmarked requests

**Export / Import**
- **⬇ EXPORT** — exports all captured requests as a HAR 1.2 file, compatible with Burp Suite, Chrome DevTools, Postman, and any HAR-aware tool
- **⬆ IMPORT** — imports a `.har` file and adds all entries to the history list

---

### ⟳ Repeater Tab
Edit and replay any captured request, or build one from scratch.

**Sessions**
- Multiple named sessions — tabbed like Burp Suite's repeater, each independent
- Sessions persist their last response while you switch between them
- **+ NEW** to create a blank session
- Close sessions with ✕

**Request Editor**
- Method dropdown + URL bar + **▶ SEND** button (`Ctrl+Enter` to send)
- **HEADERS** tab — key/value row editor, add/remove individual headers
- **BODY** tab — body textarea with Content-Type selector (JSON, Form URL Encoded, Multipart, Plain Text, XML) and **⌥ FORMAT** to auto-indent JSON
- **RAW HTTP** tab — edit the full request as raw text

**cURL Import**
Click **⬆ IMPORT CURL** to paste a cURL command directly into the Repeater. Supports:
- `-X` method, multiple `-H` headers, `-d` / `--data` / `--data-raw` body
- `-u user:pass` basic auth (auto-converted to Authorization header)
- `-b` cookie header
- `Ctrl+Enter` to import

**Response Viewer**
- Status code, response time, response size in meta pills
- **BODY** tab with RAW / PRETTY toggle
  - PRETTY renders JSON with full syntax highlighting and XML with indentation
  - PRETTY button is disabled and dimmed when the response is not a prettifiable format
- **HEADERS** tab — response headers in key/value table
- **⎘ COPY** — copy raw response body to clipboard
- **⇌ WRAP** — toggle word wrap for long minified responses

---

### ⌥ Decoder Tab
Built-in encoder/decoder for common security research transforms.

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| Base64 Decode / Encode | Standard Base64 |
| URL Decode / Encode | `%xx` percent encoding |
| HTML Decode / Encode | HTML entity encoding |
| Hex Encode / Decode | Hexadecimal byte encoding |
| JSON Format | Pretty-print and validate JSON |
| JWT Decode | Splits header, payload, signature — flags `alg: none` and `HS256` with a warning banner |
| SHA-256 Hash | Via Web Crypto API |

**Chain mode** — ⇄ button pipes the output back into the input for multi-step transforms (e.g. Base64 decode → URL decode in two clicks).

---

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl + Enter` | Send request (when focused in Repeater URL/body/raw) |
| `Ctrl + L` | Clear history |
| `Ctrl + F` | Focus the URL filter input |

### How traffic capture works

PhantomProxy uses the browser's `webRequest` API — a passive observation API that fires events for every HTTP request without intercepting or blocking traffic.

```
Page makes request
      ↓
onBeforeRequest  → captures URL, method, request body
onSendHeaders    → captures request headers
onHeadersReceived → captures response status + headers
onCompleted      → finalizes timing, pushes to requestStore
      ↓
broadcastToDevtools() → postMessage to panel port
      ↓
Panel renders row in History tab
```

The background service worker stores up to 500 requests in memory and broadcasts each completed request to all connected panels (both DevTools and standalone) via `chrome.runtime.connect` ports.

Repeater requests are fired from the background worker using `fetch()` — this bypasses CORS restrictions that would block requests from the panel page context.

### Security design

- **No data leaves the browser** — all captured traffic stays in local memory, never sent to any server
- **SSRF protection** — Repeater blocks `file://`, `javascript:`, and all private IP ranges (127.x, 10.x, 172.16–31.x, 192.168.x, 169.254.x, ::1, fc00::, fe80::)
- **CRLF injection prevention** — all header names and values strip `\r`, `\n`, and `\0` before use
- **XSS prevention** — all server-controlled values (URLs, headers, response bodies, status text) are rendered via `textContent` or DOM construction, never `innerHTML`
- **Prototype pollution guards** — all header objects use `hasOwnProperty` checks; sensitive objects use `Object.create(null)`
- **HTTP method whitelist** — only known HTTP verbs accepted in Repeater
- **Body size caps** — captured bodies truncated at 64 KB, repeater responses capped at 2 MB

## Permissions

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|---|---|
| `webRequest` | To observe HTTP traffic — the core function of the tool |
| `tabs` | To associate requests with the correct tab and populate the standalone tab selector |
| `storage` | To persist scope definitions and bookmarks across sessions |
| `scripting` | For DevTools panel integration |
| `webNavigation` | To detect page navigation and handle request lifecycle correctly |
| `windows` | To open PhantomProxy as a standalone window via the Execute button |
| `<all_urls>` | To observe requests to any domain — required since security testing targets vary |

---

## Notes

- Requires Microsoft Edge 88+ or Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 + `webRequest`)
- Response bodies are **not** captured passively in the History tab — this is a browser platform restriction of the `webRequest` API. Use the **RES PRETTY** tab or Repeater to re-send and read the response body
- The extension does **not** intercept, block, or modify live traffic — it is purely passive observation + active replay
- Works on `http://` and `https://` pages only
- Extension pages (`chrome://`, `edge://`, `devtools://`, `file://`) are excluded from capture

---

## Privacy

PhantomProxy collects no data. All captured traffic is processed entirely within your local browser and is never transmitted to any server. No analytics, no telemetry, no tracking.
